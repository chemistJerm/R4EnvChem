# Programming with R

<!-- Aim of this is to show people how they can include programming features to enhance their coding. Mostly tips and shit to get them started no encompassing guide --> 

Programming is writing instructions that tell the computer what to do. Like most things, learning a little goes a long way. And like most things, it's easy to lose the forest for the trees. That's why we won't focus too much on programming (after all you're chemist not computer scientist) but we will introduce a few simple yet incredibly powerful elements of programming to help you along with your data science quest.

We'll point to several sources for further reading on functions at the end of this chapter. 

## Functions  
  
Functions allow you to write general purpose code to automate common tasks. They're a great way to decrease repetition and make your code more legible and reproducible. To crease a function in R you only need `function()`:

```{r, error=TRUE}
funSum <- function(x,y){
  z <- x + y
  paste("The sum of", x, "+", y, "is", z, sep =" ")
}

funSum(1, 3)
funSum("yes",3)
```
What we've done is create a function called `funSum` which takes two numeric inputs `x` and `y`, sums the two into `z` and paste an output telling us the sum. A couple of things to note: 

  - We need to *explicitly* state which arguments are function will take; in this example they are `x` and `y`. Whatever we pass to `x` or `y` will be carried into the function. 
  - We can't sum non-numeric values, so R returns an error in the second instance
  - Functions create their own environment, therefore *any variable* created inside a function only exists inside the function.
    - In the above example, `x`, `y`, and `z` only exist inside the function.
  - R automatically returns whichever variable is on the last line of the body of the function; but you can explicitly ask for an output using `return()`

Let's take a look at a more practical function, something that you might actually use. In mass spectrometry, a gauge of accuracy is the *mass error*, a measure of the difference between the observed and theoretical masses, and is reported in parts-per-million (ppm). The formula for calculating mass error is:

$$ Mass~error~(ppm) = \frac{|mass_{theoretical} - mass_{experimental}|}{mass_{theorical}} \times 10^6 $$

The formula is simple enough, but you may need to calculate any number of mass errors, so it behooves us to compose a quick formula to simplify our workload:


```{r}
ppmMS <- function(theoMZ, expMZ){

  ppm <- abs(theoMZ - expMZ)/theoMZ * 1e6
  ppm
}

# Theoretical mass = 1479.63 m/z
# experimental mass = 1480.10 m/z
ppmMS(theoMZ = 1479.63, expMZ = 1480.10)
```

Pretty useful if you're manually checking something, but we can also use our functions into the pipe to help our data transformation:


```{r}

# Example data
masses <- data.frame("theo" = c(1479.63, 1479.63, 1479.63),
                     "exp" = c(1478.63, 1479.63, 1480.10))

masses %>% 
  mutate(massError = ppmMS(theo, exp))

```

This last part is critical as *functions make your code more legible*. We can clearly read that the code above is calculating the mass error between the theoretical and experimentally observed masses. This might not be as apparent if we put in a complex mathematical formula in the middle of our pipe. 


## Conditional arguments 

Are used to specify a path in a function depending on whether a statement is `TRUE` or `FALSE`. These are explored in greater detail via the links in the [Further Reading] section, but here's a quick example of a function that uses the conditional `if` statement to print out which number is largest: 

```{r}

isGreater <- function(x, y){
  if(x > y){
    return(paste(x, "is greater than", y, sep = " "))
  } else if (x < y){ 
    return(paste(x, "is less than", y, sep = " "))
  }
  return(paste(x, "is equal to", y, sep = " "))
}

isGreater (2, 1)
isGreater (1, 2)
isGreater (1, 1)

```

Our simple function compares two numbers, `x` and `y` and if `x > y` evaluate to `TRUE` it returns the pasted string `x is greater than y`. If `x < y` evaluates to `FALSE`, as in `y > x`, our function returns the pasted string `x is less than y`, and finally if neither `x > y` and `x < y` evaluate to TRUE, they must be equal! Therefore the final output is `x is equal to y`. This is an example of an `else if` statement. If you're simply evaluating two conditions (`TRUE` or `FALSE`) you only need the `if()` conditional, see [Further Reading] for more details. 

### Piping conditional statements

You can already see the potential for simply conditional statements in the pipe. However, to keep piping operations legible, `dplyr` offers the `case_when` function, which works similarly to the `else if` statements showcased above. Let's see how it works using a real world example.

In mass spectrometry undetected compounds are recorded having an intensity of 0; it's a common practice to replace 0 with $\frac{limit~of~detection}{2}$ for subsequent analysis However, we don't want to replace every value with $\frac{LOD}{2}$, only 0s. Let's use the `case_when()` function to create a new values with the recorded intensities

```{r}

lod <- 4000 # previously calculated LOD 
results <- data.frame("mz" = c(308.97, 380.81, 410.11, 445.34 ), # dummy data
                      "intensities" = c(0, 1000, 5000, 10000)) 

results %>%
  mutate(reportedIntensities = case_when(intensities < lod ~ lod/2,
                                 TRUE ~ intensities))


```

Firstly we're creating a new column called `reportedIntesities` using `mutate()` and using `case_when()` to conditionally fill that column. The inputs we've passed to `case_when()` are two-sided formulas. Essentially if the conditions on the left-hand side of the tilda (`~`) evaluate to `TRUE`, `case_when` will execute the right-hand side. Thee first two-sided formula is `intensities < lod ~ lod/2` and checks if the intensities value is less than the previously calculated limit of detection. If `intensitis < lod` evaluates to `TRUE` we insert half of the LOD value for that row. If `intentisites < lod` evaluates to `FALSE`, we move onto the next two-side formula and reevaluate again. The second two-sided formula `TRUE ~ intensities` basically means for everything that's remaining (greater than LOD in our instance) just use the value from the `intensities` column.

Some ideas to consider when working with `case-when()`:

  - There's no limits to the conditions you can pass to `case_when()`.
  - *However* `case_when()` evaluates in order so put the more specific conditions before the more general. 
  - Remember that the point of `case_when()` and piping is legibility. If you're passing multiple conditions, consider writing a function using `else if` statements to keep the pipe legible.  


## When to use functions

A good rule when coding is **Don't Repeat yourself!**. In practice, this means don't copy and paste blocks of code to multiple parts of your script. It's more difficult to read (more lines), and if you identify an issue with one block, you'll need to hunt down all the other blocks to rectify the situation (you'll always miss something!). by using functions you'll reduce the number of lines of code, but you'll also only need to check one spot to rectify the issues. 


## Troubleshooting error messages

We briefly mentioned error messages in Chapter 3.1, but once you start writing your own code you will inevitably come across many more. Here we'll go through a few of the more common errors you'll encounter and how to fix your code to resolve the issues.


### Script diagnostics

When writing code in the Script window, RStudio will highlight any syntax errors in your code with a red squiggly line and an 'x' in the side bar, as shown below. You can hover over the 'x' to see what is causing the error. 

![Figure 3.8: RStudio highlights syntax errors in the Scripts window.](images/Rstudio_diagnostics.png)

In the above message, R is telling you that it is not sure what to do with `b`. As mentioned previously, variable assignment is done in the format `name <- assignment`. However, in the above example, the variable assignment statement is written as `name name <- assignment`. Since variable names cannot contain spaces, R reads `a b` as two separate input variable names, not as a single string. If you wanted to assign a value of 0 to both `a` and `b`, you would need to write the statement once per variable, as shown below.

```{r}
a <- 0
b <- 0
```

Let's look at another example. Some functions require you to write code with nested parentheses. A good example would be the `aes()` argument that is called inside of `ggplot()`, as shown below.

```{r message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)

#import ozone data set
airPol <- read_csv("data/2018-01-01_60430_Toronto_ON.csv")
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
#plot ozone concentration vs. time
ggplot(data = airPol, 
       aes(x = date.time,
           y = concentration,
           colour = pollutant)) +
  geom_point()
```

(For more detail about importing and using `ggplot2`, please re-visit Chapter 2, section 2.3.4, or see Chapter 11.)

If you were to forget one of the parentheses in the previous line of code, RStudio would highlight it similar to below:

![Figure 3.9: RStudio highlights unmatched parentheses in the script window.](images/Rstudio_unmatched.png)

Here R is telling you that you have an unmatched opening bracket. To resolve the error, simply add a closing bracket to match. 

The `expected ',' after expression` is a common error that you will see accompanying unmatched opening brackets. Sometimes you might get this error in the console after running code that is missing a bracket somewhere. It is good practice to check your parentheses a few times before running your code to make sure that all the commands are closed, and that R doesn't keep waiting for you to continue inputting code after you've click *Run*. If you notice that the `>` in your R console has turned into a `+`, this is likely because you've just run a command that is missing a closing bracket, and thus, R is not aware that your code is finished. Simply input a closing bracket into the console, and the `>` should return.

### Reading error codes

While the script window is very useful for pointing out syntax errors in your code, there are many other errors that can arise in RStudio which the script window is not able to capture. These are generally errors that arise from trying to execute your code, rather than from mistakes in your syntax.

The following is a prime example of such an error.

```{r error = TRUE}
q <- 8 + "hi"
```

Here we are trying to add a numeric value (8) to a character string ("hi"), then set the sum of the two to variable `q`. R has given us an error in return, because there is no logical way for R to add a numeric value to non-numeric text.

The error indicates that we have passed a `non-numeric argument to binary operator`, meaning we have used a non-numeric data type for an expression which is exclusively reserved for numeric data. If you try to add, divide or multiply two character strings using arithmetic operations in the console, you will get the same error. 

```{r error = TRUE}
"hey" * "hi"
```

It is important to be aware of these error codes as many functions require specific data types as their inputs. You can always look at the required data type by looking at the documentation for the function (generally, this can be viewed by typing `?function` into the console, where `function` is the name of the function). If the function requires numeric data, inputting character strings or logical values will throw the errors shown above. If the function requires logical values, inputting numeric data or character strings will throw the errors shown above. 

In order to avoid these errors, make sure that you are using the right type of data in your functions. You can always check your data type using `class()`. Some examples are shown below.

```{r}
class("hi")

class(10)

class(1L)

class(TRUE)
```
