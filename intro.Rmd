# Installing R

You may have heard about the coding or the R programming language, but figuring out how to get started can be a hurdle; at least it was for us. This chapter will cover installing the software you'll need for coding in R.  

## Prerequisite software

Before we get started, you'll need to download the following open source and free software: 

  - **R**
  - **RStudio**
  - **`tidyverse`** suite of packages

Read on for instructions on downloading all three. 

### R

**R** is the programming language we'll code in. R is hosted on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and is one of the most popular programming languages for statisticians and scientist alike. [You can download the latest build for your operating system here](https://cloud.r-project.org/). 

A quick aside, but don't be intimidated by the term "coding". Coding is simply writing instructions for the computer to execute. The only catch is has to be in a language that both we, humans, and the computer can understand. For our needs we're using R, and like any language, R has it's own syntax, rules, and quirks which we'll cover in later chapters.
  
### RStudio

RStudio is the *integrated development environment* (IDE) of choice when working with R. It's where you'll actually be typing your code and interacting with R. Again, R is a language, and you need somewhere to write it down to make use of it. Writing in English can be done with a pencil and notepad or a word processor filed with useful tools to help you write. RStudio is the later for coding in R. [**You can download the latest version of RStudio here**](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). 

Once you have R and RStudio installed, go ahead and open up RStudio. Once you open RStudio, you'll be greeted with an interface divided into numerous panes. We've highlighted the major ones in the image below:

Each pane serves a specific role: 

  - **The console** allows you to directly type and run your code. It also provides messages, warnings, and errors from any code you run. 
  - **The environment**  window lists all variables, data, and functions you've created since the start of your coding session.  
  - **The viewer** shows your outputs, help documents, etc. which each has their own tab. 



Throughout the book, you'll see lines of code like the one below. You can copy (or type) these directly into the console window and press Enter to run them. 

```{r}
2 + 2
```

Noticed that both the code (the first part) and what the code outputs (the second part) are shown. Throughout this book code outputs will be proceeded by `##`. You can run code directly from the console. It's handy for short and sweet snippets of code, something that can be typed in a single line. For example, we can use R as a calculator:

```{r}
2 * 3
```
```{r}
pi * (10/2)
```
We'll dive into the basics of coding in R in a later chapter. For now, all we need the console for is to install our third major software component, the `tidyverse` suite of packages.


### Tidyverse

Packages are previously written snippets of code that extend the capabilities of base R. Typically packages are created to address specific issues or workflows in different types of analysis. This book will make frequent use of a family of packages called the `tidyverse`. These packages all share a common thought process and integrate naturally with one another. 

You can download the entire suite of `tidyverse` packages by simply copy and pasting the following code into the console and pressing 'enter'.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

You'll see a flurry of lines printed to the console indicating the status of the installation. Once installed you won't be able to use these functions until you load it with `library()`. Enter the code below into the console to load the `tidyverse` package.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
The output show's us which packages are included in the `tidyverse()` and their current version numbers, as well as conflicts (where functions from different packages share the same name). Don't worry about these for now. 


## Customizing RStudio

As many of us spend an absurd amount of time staring at bright screens, some of you may be interested in setting your RStudio to Dark Mode. 

You can customize the appearance of your RStudio interface by clicking *Tools*->*Global Options*, or *RStudio*->*Preferences* on Mac, then clicking "Appearance" on the left. Select your preferred Editor Theme from the list.

## Where to Get Help

While it's often tempting to contact your TA or Professor at the first sign of trouble, it's  better to try and resolve your issues on your own. Given the popularity of R, if you've run into an issue, someone else has too and they've complained about it and someone else has almost certainly solved it! An often unappreciated aspect of coding/data science is knowing *how* to get help, *how* to search for it, and *how* to translate someone's solutions to your unique situation. 

Places to get help include: 

- Google, Stack Overflow, etc. When in doubt Google it. 
- Using built-in documentation (`?help`)
- reference books such as the invaluable [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html), which inspired this entire project. 
- And yes, when all else fails, holler at your TA/profs. 

## Summary

In this chapter we've covered: 

  - Installing and running R and RStudio
  - Running R code from the console
  - Installing the `tidyverse()` package, the basis of the subsequent code in this book
  - How to customize the appearance of RStudio so you don't burn out your eyes at night

In the next chapter we'll break down how to setup your work in R for legibility, simplicity, and reproducibility. After all, the person cursing any of your sloppy work will invariably be you, so be kind to yourself, and do it right the first time.
