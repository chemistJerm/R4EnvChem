# (PART\*) Section 1: Getting Started With R {-}

# Installing R

You may have already heard of coding and the programming language R, but figuring out how to get started can be a little overwhelming. That’s why we wrote this textbook; to give you the resources we wish we’d had when we were beginners. This chapter will cover installing the software you'll need for coding in R.  

## Prerequisite software

Before we get started, you'll need to download the following open source and free software: 

  - **R**
  - **RStudio**
  - **`tidyverse`** suite of packages

Read on for instructions on downloading all three. 

### R

**R** is the programming language we'll code in. Coding is simply writing instructions for the computer to execute. To do this, we need a language that both we, humans, and the computer can understand. For our needs we'll use R, and like any language R has it's own syntax, rules, and quirks (which we'll cover in later sections).

R is hosted on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and is one of the most popular programming languages for statisticians and scientists alike. [You can download the latest build for your operating system here](https://cloud.r-project.org/). 


  
### Downloading RStudio IDE

RStudio is the *integrated development environment* of choice when working with R. It's where we'll actually be typing our code and interacting with R. Again, R is a language, and we need somewhere to write it down to make use of it. RStudio is to R as a word processor is to English. [You can download the latest version of RStudio here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). 

Once you have R and RStudio installed, go ahead and open up RStudio. Once you open RStudio, you'll be greeted with an interface divided into numerous panes. We've highlighted the major ones in the image below:

Each pane serves a specific role: 

  - **The console** allows us to directly type and run our code. It also provides messages, warnings, and errors from any code we run. 
  - **The environment**  window lists all variables, data, and functions we've created since the start of our coding session.  
  - **The viewer** shows your files, generated plots, and help documents. Each of these has their own tab. 


## Customizing RStudio (Optional)

As many of us spend an absurd amount of time staring at bright screens, some of you may be interested in setting your RStudio to Dark Mode. 

You can customize the appearance of your RStudio interface by clicking *Tools*->*Global Options*, or *RStudio*->*Preferences* on Mac, then clicking "Appearance" on the left. Select your preferred Editor Theme from the list. My personal favourite is `Tomorrow Night Bright`, but feel free to try a few until you find one that works for you.

## Where to get help

While it's often tempting to contact your TA or Professor at the first sign of trouble, it's often better to try and resolve your issues on your own, especially if they're related to technical issues in R. Given the popularity of R, if you've run into an issue, someone else has too and they complained about it online, and someone else has almost certainly solved it! An often unappreciated aspect of coding/data science is knowing how to get help, how to search for it, and how to translate someone's solutions to your unique situation.

Places to get help include: 

- Google, Stack Overflow, etc. When in doubt Google it. 
- reference books such as the invaluable [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html), which inspired this entire project. 
- And yes, when all else fails, holler at your TA/profs. 

## Summary

In this chapter we've covered: 

  - Installing and running R and RStudio
  - How to customize the appearance of RStudio so you don't burn out your eyes at night

In the next chapter, we’ll learn how to set ourselves up for success by organizing our code files into an RStudio Project. It may sound tedious, but it’s a short step which will save us a great deal of frustration later.
